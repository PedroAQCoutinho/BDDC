# BDDC - Brazilian deforestation data comparison

The Brazilian deforestation data are very complex and bring some uncertainty. Among the possible databases for estimating deforestation there are many differences in the data, which can lead to misuse.
In this repository there is a script to explore these datasets and their differences.

## Datasets: PRODES, GLAD, MAPBIOMAS

This is the first part of a collaborative work supported by the University of SÃ£o Paulo and the public policy group. The first part of the project was led by Pietro Fernandes (https://github.com/pietrogf) and consisted of database consolidation and initial exploratory data analysis. The codes for this stage of the project are in the first-part branch 

The main data sources for use in Brazil are: (i) PRODES - the official data published by INPE (public agency); (ii) MAPBIOMAS - NGO initiative that relies on expert validation to estimate land use and deforestation data from machine learning algorithms; (iii) GLAD - Global deforestation data generated by the University of Maryland
