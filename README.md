# BDDC - Brazilian deforestation data comparison

The Brazilian deforestation data are very complex and bring some uncertainty. Among the possible databases for estimating deforestation there are many differences in the data, which can lead to misuse.
We created this repository to work simultaneously on different branches. The goal is to explore the available data for deforestation in Brazil and to fit models to explain its causes and make predictions.
