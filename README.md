# BDDC - Brazilian deforestation data comparison

The Brazilian deforestation data are very complex and bring some uncertainty. Among the possible databases for estimating deforestation there are many differences in the data, which can lead to misuse.
In this repository there is a script to explore these datasets and their differences.

## Datasets: PRODES, GLAD, MAPBIOMAS

The workflow for generating the compiled database is not yet organized. 
The main data sources for use in Brazil are: (i) PRODES - the official data published by INPE (public agency); (ii) MAPBIOMAS - NGO initiative that relies on expert validation to estimate land use and deforestation data from machine learning algorithms; (iii) GLAD - Global deforestation data generated by the University of Maryland
